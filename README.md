# Introduction

Microsoft Dynamics 356 Business Central is an ERP system that can be easily customized with AL language extensions. This workbook has been prepared to guide you through the basics of development.

I hope that after reading it and doing all the tasks you will get familiar with the basics of developing in the AL Language. You should know that this is only the start. There are much more functionalities in the programming language but here you will see the essentials which will give you the fundaments to build more advanced extensions.

How should you work with it? First, it is not a book. I would like to encourage you to print it (if you already do not have a hard copy) and write in it. Make some notes and write down the things which you would like to explore more. That is why I am calling it WORKBOOK.

In the document, you will see some code that you need to write. I would like to ask you something. **Do not copy it!** Try to write it by yourself. Use this which you can find here as an example and reference. This way you will understand more and get familiar with how to do it later by yourself.

I hope you will like the structure and the content. If so, please share some thoughts on social media such as LinkedIn, and Twitter or comment on the blog MyNAVBlog.com.

The material here is fully free of charge. If you like you can use it in your organization or prepare the workshops for your colleagues. Please only do not remove copyrights from the materials.

# About Version 2 (Current)
After I prepared the first version of this workbook a lot has changed. First of all, the current version of Dynamics 365 Business Central is 20.3 and many things have been added to the language since 2019. I decided to update the workbook since a lot of people start using it and had comments (thank you Steve for pushing me for this update).

I updated the way how to work with docker and focus less on non-important things. Also added more exercises that were inspired by people who were new to Business Central (Radek thank you for all your comments).

The general idea about is workbook did not change. Still, it is for people which are starting to learn AL development.

From a technical perspective, I changed the tools used to prepare the workbook â€“ the reason now more people can contribute to it. Now it is available also in the Word.
